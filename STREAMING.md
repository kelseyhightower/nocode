#Streaming No Code
Streaming no code is almost as easy as standard no code. You're still not doing any coding, but now you also
adopt the policy of not going back to things you previously failed to code and adding code to them and trying
not to dwell on other things you've written no code for in the past, all while being careful not to get in the 
way of other people who are also trying not to do anything.

Streaming allows you to write and deploy no code to systems in real time, where real time is defined as "fast enough
that your boss never has to dog you about it being slow." Streaming no code is actually beyond real time -- it's done in
no time, flat.

No code also features no locking, no blocking, and no contention. Well, that's not entirely true. You still need a PR Review.

##To get started:

First, write and deploy some standard no code.

Next, keep at it. 

Look at you! You're streaming!

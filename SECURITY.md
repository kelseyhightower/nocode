# Security Policy

Software security researchers are increasingly engaging with Internet companies to hunt down vulnerabilities. Our bounty program gives a tip of the hat to these researchers and provides great rewards for critical vulnerabilities.

If youâ€™ve found a vulnerability, you can keep in touch or open a pull request, with detailed information about and your full implementation.

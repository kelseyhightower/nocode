# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

All versions are supported. No-code is perpetually up-to-date.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

No-code = No vulnerabilities.

Should you discover a vulnerability in no-code, take immediate action by doing absolutely nothing.
Please write an ultra-detailed log of the issue, ensuring that the file size does not exceed 0 bytes, then send it to dev/null

Thank you for your cooperation.

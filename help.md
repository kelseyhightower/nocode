## Importing libraries
Libraries are a packet of nocode. We can use libraries to conserve no code.  
You can use `` to import libraries, here is an example:
```

```
## Defining variables
Variables are used for storing things, you may need to define a variable for putting things.  
Defining variables is written like this:
```

```
## The main function
The main functions are designed to run codes. But we don't need code, so we often don't use the main function.  
Now your application should be like this:
```

```
## Printing things
Sometimes you'll need an output to layout variables or other things.  
You can use ` ` to print things. For example:
```

```
You will get the output like this:
```

```
## Judging by using " "
We use ` ` to judge two arguments.
It is written like this:
```

```

## looping by using " " and " "
We use ` ` and ` ` to loop functions.
It has the same grammar as ` `:
```

```
## Creating a class
We use classes to abstract the characteristics of objects to form a piece of code.  
Class is not used in nocode, because nocode doesn't need to form codes.

## Example
Here is some example of the nocode.  
1.
```

```
This program will print all the ` ` in ` `  
2.
```

```
This program will handle ` ` and print it  
3.
```

```
This program will give you the following output:
```

```

## More things you can do
You had learned so many things above, it's time to create your nocode.  
You can do anything you want with nocode by just imagining what you want, and no code will appear ahead of you.  
The only thing you need to remember is DO NOT write ANY code, or else no code will effect.

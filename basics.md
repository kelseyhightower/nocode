Alright so you have installed the repository. Good job ðŸŽ‰
now let's began with writing some code-?

**here's how to define a `variable`**
Variable names can be arbitrarily long
```

```

to **print** these, this is what you do
```

```

you can't use variables with these names-
```










```

**wanna add subtract multiply divide differentiate exponent or any mathematical funtion?**
do it this way
```






```

also you can define if you want to use BODMAS or PEMDAS using **modules** like this
```



```

**asking the user for input**

if you want a custom value for anything given by the user you can use this built in funtion to do so-
```

```

**Comments**

as your programs gets bigger chances are you will have some trouble finding some code here and that - comments can fix that - you can write as much as comments as you want without it being excecuted like this

```



```

here are some **practice exercises** for you to get started with the basics

1. write a program to get an input from a user and welcome them
2. write a program to add 1+1
3. what will be the output of the following:
```







```

**solutions:**

program 1-
```



```

program 2-
```



```
OR
```





```

output for program 3 -
```

```

more features coming soon I hope you enjoyed using nocode!

`nocode` is an important strategy to create every sorts of applications at an unprecedented speed and at a drastically reduced cost and that they are well suited for the cloud and for starting small and scaling very quickly. You will explore what a `nocode` platform is and why it matters to you.

A `nocode` platform offers the following advantages over traditional development platforms:

1) It allows developers to create web applications using point-and-click/drag-and-drop and metadata model methodology and to extend the application with code at specific hook points.
2) It offers lots of built-in services. When you come from a world of traditional web programming, this is a huge departure from it as you won’t have to re-invent many services that you will need sooner or later.
3) It provides an environment where you can develop, deploy, run, scale and manage your application, all from a single place.

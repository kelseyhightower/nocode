# No Code AWS example

This is a basic example to deploy nothing to AWS services with the No Code framework. As you can see, we're not writing any code in `src/app.js` and our `eslint` config is an empty, airbnb-style template since we're not linting any code at all!

Yes, it is that simple.

## Deployment

We're also not setting up any build settings for our non-existent code since it is the No Code belief that not configuring means no deployment, which in turn results in a more efficient application that can be run anywhere without any issues.

Have fun trying it out! It's a basic template, so you can modify it to suit all your business needs.

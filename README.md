# blubb Code

blubb code is the best way to write secure and reliable applications. Write blubb; deploy nowhere.

## Getting Started

Start by not writing just a word.

```
blubb
```

This is just an example application, but imagine it doing anything you want. Adding new features is easy too:

```
blubb blubb
```

The possibilities are endless.

### Building the Application

Now that you have so much, it's time to build your application:

```
blubb
```

Yep. That's it. You should see the following output:

```
blubb
```

### Deploying

While you just got the richest person in the universe, it's time to deploy your application. By running the following command (23 times blubb) you can deploy your application absolutely blubbwhere.

```
blubb blubb blubb blubb blubb blubb blubb blubb blubb blubb blubb blubb blubb blubb blubb blubb blubb blubb blubb blubb blubb blubb blubb
```

It's that simple. And when it comes time to scale the application, all you have to do is:

```
blubb
```

I know right?

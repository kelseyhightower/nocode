# No Code

No code is the best way to write secure and reliable applications. Write nothing; deploy nowhere.

## Getting Started

Start by not writing any code.

```

```

```

The possibilities are endless.

### Building the Application

Now that you have not done anything it's time to build your application:

```

```

Yep. That's it. You should see the following output:

```

```

### Deploying

While you still have not done anything it's time to deploy your application. By running the following command you can easily deploy your application absolutely anywhere.

```

```

It's that simple. And when it comes time to scale the application, all you have to do is:

```

```

I know right?

# No Code

No code is the best way to write secure and reliable applications. Write nothing; deploy nowhere.

## Getting Started

Start by not writing any code.

```

```

This is just an example application, but imagine it doing anything you want. Adding new features is easy too:

```

```

The possibilities are endless.

### Building the Application

Now that you have not done anything it's time to build your application:

```

```

Yep. That's it. You should see the following output:

```

```

### Deploying

While you still have not done anything it's time to deploy your application. No code runs on any stack, including, but not limited to, AWS, GCP, Azure, and even on-premise servers. By running the following command you can deploy your application absolutely nowhere.

```

```
It's that simple. 

No code is perfectly written for infinite horizontal and vertical scaling. Just update the configs found nowhere, and run the below command.

```

```
Run it as many times as needed. Note that no code automatically load balances nothing.

### Compliance

No code also meets both GDPR and HIPAA compliance. By tracking no information, and not having any existant users, No code is able to remove all liability on the developer's part. (NOTE: all guarantees of compliance are waived if no code is altered, or used within another project. No code is not responsible for any data that is maintained in any persistant or ephemeral state. No code is only responsible for no data)

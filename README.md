# No Code

No code is the best way to write secure and reliable applications. Write nothing; deploy nowhere.

## Getting Started

Start by not writing any code.

```

```

This is just an example application, but imagine it doing anything you want. Adding new features is easy too:

```

```

The possibilities are endless.

### Building the Application

Now that you have not done anything it's time to build your application:

```

```

Yep. That's it. You should see the following output:

```

```

### Deploying

While you still have not done anything it's time to deploy your application. By running the following command you can deploy your application absolutely nowhere.

```

```

It's that simple. And when it comes time to scale the application, all you have to do is:

```

```

I know right?

### Fault Tolerance 

Since there is nocode, that runs nowhere, we inherently have Fault tolerance. Have a look at the following: 

```

```

I know, this is revolutionary!

### Disaster recovery
When a catastrophic disaster event occurs, the system continues in its nocode norun policy. This can be implemented in all cloud and non-cloud platforms in existence and yet to be invented.

Here is an example nocode on Microsoft Azure. Same can be achieved on AWS Cloud.

```

```

Take a moment to absorb that.

# No Code

No code is the best way to write secure and reliable applications. Write nothing; deploy nowhere.

## Getting Started

Start by not writing any code.

```

```

This is just an example application, but imagine it doing anything that is wanted. Adding new features is easy too:

```

```

The possibilities are endless.

### Building the Application

Now that nothing has been done, it's time to build the application:

```

```

Yep. That's it. The following output should be seen:

```

```

### Deploying

While nothing still has not been done, it's time to deploy the application. By running the following command the application can be deployed absolutely nowhere.

```

```

It's that simple. And when it comes time to scale the application, all that has to be done:

```

```

"I know right?"

## Contributing

It cannot be done.
